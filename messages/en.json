              "Book a smaller gulet rather than a large party boat if you prefer a more relaxed atmosphere. The experience is more intimate and stops are less crowded.",
              "Bring reef-safe sunscreen, a hat, and water shoes for rocky beaches. Most boats provide towels, but bringing your own doesn't hurt.",

              "You'll share meals, swimming stops, and deck space with 8-16 other guests. It's inherently social - perfect for solo travelers or couples who enjoy meeting new people.",

              "Per person, this often works out more expensive, but for families or groups of friends, the value increases significantly. A group of 10 on a €15,000 charter pays €1,500 per person.",
              "Flexibility is the biggest advantage. Want to stay longer at a beautiful bay? No problem. Prefer to skip a crowded port? Your captain will adjust."

              "Consider a compromise: some operators offer 'mini charters' where you can book the entire boat for 4-5 nights at a reduced rate."
